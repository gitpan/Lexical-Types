Revision history for Lexical-Types

0.06    2009-05-01 19:00 UTC
        + Fix : The pragma now properly propagates into threaded eval STRING,
                effectively making the module thread safe. The new LT_THREADSAFE
                constant can be used to know whether the module could have been
                built with thread safety features enabled.

0.05    2009-04-28 21:40 UTC
        + Fix : Building with PERL_IMPLICIT_SYS set (especially on Win32).
        + Tst : Dieing in callbacks.

0.04    2009-03-07 15:45 UTC
        + Chg : Some implementation of pointer table is now used internally.
                This should make thread safety more robust.
        + Doc : Cleanups.
        + Tst : Using Lexical::Types inside the 'as' callback.
        + Tst : Thread safety.

0.03    2009-03-05 21:15 UTC
        + Doc : Discuss about using constants for types.
        + Fix : The PL_ppaddr[OP_PADSV] localization logic was refined so that
                it is kinder to other modules that replace it.
        + Tst : "my Str ($x, $y)" and "for my Str $x ()" constructs
        + Tst : uvar magic, magical tags.

0.02    2009-02-25 16:10 UTC
        + Add : Returning an empty list from the mangler skips the wrapping of
                the current typed lexical declaration.
        + Chg : The package and method names passed to the callbacks are now all
                read-only.

        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
